        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "  - The main difference between compiled and interpreted languages is when the code is translated into machine code.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - Exception handling in Python is a technique for managing errors that occur while a program is running. It allows programs to continue running or exit gracefully when an error occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "  - The purpose of a finally block in exception handling is to ensure that important code is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "  - Python logging is a module that tracks events that occur while a program is running.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - __del__ is a finalizer. It is called when an object is garbage collected which happens at some point after all references to the object have been deleted. In a simple case this could be right after you say del x or, if x is a local variable, after the function ends.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "  - In general, you should use the import statement when you need to use many attributes from a module, or when the module name is short and easy to remember. You should use the from statement when you only need to use a few attributes from a module, or when the module name is long and hard to remember.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, multiple exceptions are handled using the try and except blocks. The try block contains the code that might throw an exception, and the except block contains the code that runs if an exception occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "  - The with statement in Python is used to simplify the management of resources that need to be acquired and released in a specific order.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "  - Multiprocessing uses two or more CPUs to increase computing power, whereas multithreading uses a single process with multiple code segments to increase computing power.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "  - Using logging in a program provides significant advantages for debugging, monitoring application performance, analyzing user behavior, identifying security issues, and overall understanding how the software is operating.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "  - Memory management in Python is the process of allocating and freeing up memory for programs to run efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, the basic steps for exception handling involve using a \"try\" block to enclose code that might raise an exception, an \"except\" block to handle the exception if it occurs, and optionally, an \"else\" block to execute code if no exception is raised, and a \"finally\" block to run code regardless of whether an exception occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "  - Memory management in Python is important because it helps programs run efficiently and prevents memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "  - In exception handling, \"try\" and \"except\" are used to define a block of code where potential errors might occur (\"try\"), and a separate block to handle those errors if they arise (\"except\").\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "  - Python's garbage collection (GC) is a system that automatically frees up memory for objects that are no longer in use.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "  - The purpose of the else block in exception handling is to execute code when no exceptions occur in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "  - Python's logging module supports five logging levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "  - The only real difference between the os. fork and multiprocessing. Process is portability and library overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "  - Closing a file after use is important because it frees up system resources that are being used by the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, the `read()` method is used to read a specified number of characters from a file or input stream, while the `readline()` method is used to read a single line from a file or input stream.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "  - Python logging is a module that allows you to track events that occur while your program is running.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "  - Python has a built-in os module with methods for interacting with the operating system, like creating files and directories, management of files and directories, input, output, environment variables, process management, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "  - The primary challenge with memory management in Python lies in the potential for memory leaks due to circular references, where objects reference each other indefinitely, preventing the garbage collector from reclaiming unused memory, which can lead to performance degradation and crashes if not properly managed.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "  - To manually raise an exception in Python, use the raise statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "  - Multi-threading allows you to make the best use out of your existing hardware resources and also allows simple resource sharing.\n",
